        <h2> Vinicius Valentim Pereira </h2>
        <p>I'm a beginner Full-stack and Python developer looking to improve my skills. I'm studying Computer Engineering at Universidade de Sorocaba (UNISO).
        My first contact with programming was during my teenage years in a game development class, where I learned block-based programming.</p>

        <p>Later, I was introduced to Python and after Javascript, and my overall exposure to technology deepened
        during my Mechatronics technical course, from which I graduated in 2021.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing football and basketball,
        going to the gym, playing Valorant, and either playing or listening to music.</p>
